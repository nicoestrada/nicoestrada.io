This was submitted at the Open Hacks 2020 Hackathon with the help of my three other teammates. We wanted to help our front line heroes leverage technology to scale their operations. We discovered that while a lot of healthcare professionals are exposed to COVID-19, there are hardly any exceptional alternatives for quarantine. Since hospitality business is at an all-time low, hotels have expressed their desire to help. We want to enable these communities to help each other.
